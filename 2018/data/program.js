But figuring out how to get clients can be challenging, and not everyone sees the benefits of cuddling as easily as you do!  \n\nIn this 3-hour workshop, we’ll dive deep into who your ideal cuddle clients are, how to reach them and what to say to them, so that they get what you’re up to, and sign up right away. You’ll learn how to tune out marketing tactics that aren’t right for you, and implement the ones that work best for you and your audience. And you’ll learn how to collaborate with other cuddle professionals so that you all get more business.\n\nThis is not just theory! You’ll leave this workshop with a concrete action plan for what to do and where to do it. \n\nWhether you’re running group workshops like Cuddle Party, or working 1-on-1 with individual cuddle clients, this pre-con workshop will help you bring in more clients and make more money — all while helping people in the ways that matter most to you.",

Far too often cisgender (gender-normative) folk feel awkward, tentative or hesitant to engage with transitioning folk, making this period even tougher.  This makes trans folk - especially transitioning folk - both a perfect client for cuddlers and also a specific challenge.   My talk aims to provide basic understanding of the transgender experience, clear some common misconceptions, and provide guidance to touch professionals in interacting with trans and non-binary clients.",
