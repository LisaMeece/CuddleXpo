But figuring out how to get clients can be challenging, and not everyone sees the benefits of cuddling as easily as you do!  \n\nIn this 3-hour workshop, we’ll dive deep into who your ideal cuddle clients are, how to reach them and what to say to them, so that they get what you’re up to, and sign up right away. You’ll learn how to tune out marketing tactics that aren’t right for you, and implement the ones that work best for you and your audience. And you’ll learn how to collaborate with other cuddle professionals so that you all get more business.\n\nThis is not just theory! You’ll leave this workshop with a concrete action plan for what to do and where to do it. \n\nWhether you’re running group workshops like Cuddle Party, or working 1-on-1 with individual cuddle clients, this pre-con workshop will help you bring in more clients and make more money — all while helping people in the ways that matter most to you.","loc":["Main Programming"]},{},{"title":"Meet and Greet Snuggle","date":"2018-09-28","time":"19:00","mins":"180","loc":["Main Programming"]},{"title":"A Gender Primer - Interacting with Trans & Non-Binary Folk","date":"2018-09-29","time":"09:30","mins":"60","desc":"We all know how important nurturing touch is to all of us. Nurturing touch becomes even more important when any of us are enduring a period of hardship, a loss, an illness or a crisis. Within an already touch-deprived culture, trans folk suffer this to an even higher degree.   For trans folk, transition period (2-5 years) is comparable to enduring a life-threatening illness. Far too often cisgender (gender-normative) folk feel awkward, tentative or hesitant to engage with transitioning folk, making this period even tougher.  This makes trans folk - especially transitioning folk - both a perfect client for cuddlers and also a specific challenge.   My talk aims to provide basic understanding of the transgender experience, clear some common misconceptions, and provide guidance to touch professionals in interacting with trans and non-binary clients.","loc":["Main Programming"]},{"title":"Handling Conflict Like a Badass","date":"2018-09-29","time":"10:40","mins":"60","loc":["Main Programming"]},{"title":"Sex Work & Us","date":"2018-09-29","time":"10:40","mins":"60","loc":["Discussion Room"]},{"title":"My Experience with Vlogging … What I’ve learned along the way with Facebook Live and YouTube","date":"2018-09-29","time":"13:20","mins":"60","loc":["Main Programming"]},{"title":"Use My Body: The Nuances of Allowing Touch from Paying Clients","date":"2018-09-29","time":"13:20","mins":"60","loc":["Presentation Room"]},{"title":"A Touch of Masculinity - Professional Cuddling as a Male Practitioner","date":"2018-09-29","time":"13:20","mins":"60","loc":["Discussion Room"]},{"title":"At Our Fingertips: Addressing the Loneliness Epidemic with Human Touch","date":"2018-09-29","time":"14:30","mins":"60","loc":["Main Programming"]},{"title":"Online Cuddle Training: Overview and Panel Discussion","date":"2018-09-29","time":"14:30","mins":"60","loc":["Presentation Room"]},{"title":"Reframing Rejection","date":"2018-09-29","time":"14:30","mins":"60","loc":["Discussion Room"]},{"title":"Pose Clinic","date":"2018-09-29","time":"15:40","mins":"60","loc":["Main Programming"]},{"title":"I Like You...*and* You're My Client","date":"2018-09-29","time":"15:40","mins":"60","loc":["Presentation Room"]},{"title":"Educating While Marketing","date":"2018-09-29","time":"15:40","mins":"60","loc":["Discussion Room"]},{"title":"Cuddle Party","date":"2018-09-29","time":"18:00","mins":"180","loc":["Main Programming"]},{"title":"KEYNOTE: Professional Cuddling: Where We’ve Been / Where We’re Going","date":"2018-09-30","time":"09:30","mins":"60","desc":"Cuddle Party co-founder Marcia Baczynski gives an overview of the last 15 years of professional cuddling, takes a look at current issues and ethical considerations in our field and lays forth a vision of where pro cuddling can go over the next decade or two.","loc":["Main Programming"]},{"title":"What's the big deal about asking for what we want?","date":"2018-09-30","time":"10:30","mins":"60"},{"title":"Screening Clients / Safety","date":"2018-09-30","time":"10:30","mins":"60"},{"title":"Facilitation: The Art of Making it Easy","date":"2018-09-30","time":"10:30","mins":"60"},{"title":"Serving and Accepting: A beautiful relationship!","date":"2018-09-30","time":"11:40","mins":"60"},{"title":"Connecting while Cuddling: Bringing Your Authentic Self to Your Clients","date":"2018-09-30","time":"11:40","mins":"60"},{"title":"Navigating a personal, romantic relationship while being a pro-cuddler","date":"2018-09-30","time":"11:40","mins":"60"},{"title":"Deep Listening - The Key to Connecting with Your Clients without Burning Out","date":"2018-09-30","time":"14:20","mins":"60"},{"title":"Sex, Money and Dirty Things: A Guide to Shame-Free Cuddling","date":"2018-09-30","time":"14:20","mins":"60"},{"title":"Standards and Practices: Straw Model Discussion","date":"2018-09-30","time":"14:20","mins":"60"},{"title":"Standards and Practices: Straw Model Discussion","date":"2018-09-30","time":"15:30","mins":"180"}]
