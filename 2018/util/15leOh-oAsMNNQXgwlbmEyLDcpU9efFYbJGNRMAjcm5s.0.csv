2,Get Cuddle Clients (Without Losing Your Soul),,Main Programming,2018-09-28,12:00,180,"You got into professional cuddling to help people, to make a difference and to change how the world sees intimacy and affection. But figuring out how to get clients can be challenging, and not everyone sees the benefits of cuddling as easily as you do!  

In this 3-hour workshop, we’ll dive deep into who your ideal cuddle clients are, how to reach them and what to say to them, so that they get what you’re up to, and sign up right away. You’ll learn how to tune out marketing tactics that aren’t right for you, and implement the ones that work best for you and your audience. And you’ll learn how to collaborate with other cuddle professionals so that you all get more business.

This is not just theory! You’ll leave this workshop with a concrete action plan for what to do and where to do it. 

Whether you’re running group workshops like Cuddle Party, or working 1-on-1 with individual cuddle clients, this pre-con workshop will help you bring in more clients and make more money — all while helping people in the ways that matter most to you.",,,,1,Marcia Baczynski,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4,A Gender Primer - Interacting with Trans & Non-Binary Folk,,Main Programming,2018-09-29,09:30,60,"We all know how important nurturing touch is to all of us. Nurturing touch becomes even more important when any of us are enduring a period of hardship, a loss, an illness or a crisis. Within an already touch-deprived culture, trans folk suffer this to an even higher degree.   For trans folk, transition period (2-5 years) is comparable to enduring a life-threatening illness. Far too often cisgender (gender-normative) folk feel awkward, tentative or hesitant to engage with transitioning folk, making this period even tougher.  This makes trans folk - especially transitioning folk - both a perfect client for cuddlers and also a specific challenge.   My talk aims to provide basic understanding of the transgender experience, clear some common misconceptions, and provide guidance to touch professionals in interacting with trans and non-binary clients.",,,,3,Cassie Brighter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,Sex Work & Us ,,Discussion Room,2018-09-29,10:40,60,"One of the most prevalent challenges that professional cuddlers face is distinguishing their work
from the sexwork industry, but are we really that different? This panel will feature the voices of
sexworkers and touch professionals alike to examine the intersection between the two
industries and where they diverge. We will have an opportunity to celebrate the contributions
both industries make to better our society and learn from the panelists experiences.",,,,16,Keeley Shoup,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,Handling Conflict Like a Badass,,Main Programming,2018-09-29,10:40,60,"What if my client has body odor? Or keeps texting me as if we’re best friends? Or uses language during our sessions that I find offensive? Being a professional cuddler takes compassion and a loving heart. But it also requires kick butt boundaries. Initiating delicate conversations takes courage; having them go smoothly takes technique. In this session, you’ll learn the O.C.E.A.N. method for navigating challenging talks. You’ll have a chance to practice and will leave with a powerful tool that you can use for a lifetime. Bring a pen to take notes!",,,,2,Jean Franzblau,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this discussion we will speak on what challenges male practitioners face, what stereotypes do they have to overcome, how their practice helps fight the Patriarchy, and how some of their experiences are unique to our profession.",,,,6,Yoni Allen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

11,At Our Fingertips: Addressing the Loneliness Epidemic with Human Touch,,Main Programming,2018-09-29,14:30,60,"The World Health Organization has declared loneliness a greater health risk than smoking, and as bad for your health as obesity. Isolation amongst older adults is on the rise, especially in first-world nations. Great Britain recently appointed a Minister of Loneliness to address this problem. I propose that human touch is an abundant, inexpensive, and underutilized tool that can address this growing health epidemic.

In this talk, I will discuss the cultural factors that lead to loneliness, the health issues isolation is causing us, and the corresponding positive health benefits of touch and oxytocin. I will talk about reframing touch as an essential component of health and wellness, and also as a social, community-building activity. I will then look at some of the ways that touch might be prescribed to various populations as a treatment for loneliness and isolation. The session will end with a q-and-a period.

15,I Like You...*and* You're My Client,,Presentation Room,2018-09-29,15:40,60,"I will discuss different types of intimacy, how we conflate them as a society, and what we can and can't give to our clients in terms of intimacy. As cuddlists, we are often very good at providing emotional intimacy in addition to platonic physical intimacy, but when we find ourselves liking our clients or when our clients feel our relationship is more than just professional, how do we discuss these topics with them? How can we communicate care, while maintaining professional boundaries? How can be honest with ourselves and our clients? This would be both a presentation about my experiences and thoughts on the topic as well as a facilitated discussion on how others have done this successfully. ",,,,10,Nikki,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This leads into discussing how this shows up in sessions and how we interact with our clients based on this awareness. It is a perfect part one to my second submission, though either one can stand alone. I would like to offer them back to back so that people can stay for both if they would like to.",,,,12,Madelon Guinazzo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We encourage you to consider what information you will share with your clients about yourself and if possible prepare your elevator speech (60 seconds or less about who you are and why you do this work).

Learn to build a strong friendship with your clients like they haven’t experienced in their day-to-day lives by seeing them for who they show up as, learning to follow your curiosity in conversation, appreciating their unique gifts, and accepting them for who they are.

24,Deep Listening - The Key to Connecting with Your Clients without Burning Out,,Main Programming,2018-09-30,14:20,60,"One of the best things we can do for our clients is Deep Listening where we listen to them with acceptance, compassion, and no pressure to perform for us. Combining our listening with platonic, consensual touch is transformational. Having your professional cuddle session be a place of Deep Listening adds value to the client and enjoyment for you. But how do you really do it? Did you learn it in school? In your relationships? How do you listen without judging, fixing, or burning out? Kassandra has been studying and teaching Deep Listening for at least 7 years. In this workshop we’ll explore the 5 Keys to Deep Listening and practice them with each other. We’ll also look at what gets in the way of listening including our own desires to be heard and our underlying beliefs about how to be a ""good cuddler"" or a ""good listener"". You will leave with at least one new skill to enrich your your cuddling, information on how to learn more Deep Listening practices, and a feeling of renewal from your own experience of Deep Listening.",,,,13,Kassandra Brown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25,"Sex, Money and Dirty Things: A Guide to Shame-Free Cuddling",,Presentation Room,2018-09-30,14:20,60,"Most touch professionals and enthusiasts have overcome some degree of stigma and shame around intimacy. But many of us are still carrying around shame and judgement about money. We will explore questions such as, which issues around money are unique to touch professionals? How do we keep taboos around ‘sex for money’ from tainting our work as touch and intimacy practitioners? And how do we identify and relinquish personal baggage around money that may be holding us back from abundance in our professional lives. 

Money is no more intrinsically dirty than touch, intimacy or sex. It’s our thoughts and beliefs that make us feel dirty. This workshop focuses on creating clarity, joy and abundance around money. Participants will be guided through three exercises in changing negative thoughts and beliefs to create clarity and abundance in their work as touch practitioners.
